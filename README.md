This is a responsive app built with JavaScript and React that fetches random jokes from https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/Any and displays them in the browser. The background color of the app changes randomly, with the random colors chosen automatically to be pleasant to look at.

The app includes buttons to fetch a new joke or tweet the current one.

Have fun!
